# Lithium

Lithium is an open-source solution for university clubs to better enhance the experience for their members. It was developed with the [Acadia Computer Science Society]() in mind, as well as some other features that were sought to be useful. 

**Disclosure: As of 7/20/22 The ACSS does not endorse this project or have any ties to said project, and it is purely a passion project by one of its members, Alex.**

This bot is programmed in python, so it is rather slow on larger-scale, but if you're interested in hosting it yourself, it should fit your needs quite well. If not, it's open-sourced, so change it to fit your needs.
