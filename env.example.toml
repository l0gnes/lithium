[SETTINGS]

    # This will dump an empty version of this file as 'env.example.toml'
    # Mainly used for updating the repository, you shouldn't have this enabled
    # as it's not needed.
    # If you do dump an empty version of this file, it will not include comments
    # and it will not include as much spacing, so bear that in mind.

    # Enabling this bot will allow the bot to be used in any server it is in.
    # Use at your own risk, despite the risk probably being non-existent.
    # tl;dr: Disabled the whitelist

    # An array of users who will always have access to the bot's commands
    # no matter the guild. This is ideally used when setting up the first
    # server for the bot.
    MASTER_USER_IDS = []

    # An array of guilds that the bot will always have whitelisted. This is to
    # prevent the possibility of somebody de-whitelisting all the servers and not
    # being able to re-add it because the bot keep denying them.

    # bot starts, rather than every hour.

[ACTIVITY]

    # (i.e, the part of your usercard that says you're playing a game)
    # It is purely aesthetic

    # Whether or not the custom activity status is enabled
    # If you disabled this you can skip the rest of this section.

    # (*) : In order to use the streaming option, the bot will need to use a valid livestream link,
    # since it doesn't matter, the default stream is the Wendy's livestream. It doesn't matter if the livestream
    # is actually live or not. However if it is, it will display that stream when the user popover is opened on discord.
